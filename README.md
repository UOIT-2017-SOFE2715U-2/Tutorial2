# Tutorial2
Group assignment for tutorial 2. It is about linked list.

Tutorial 2 Activity

For this tutorial activity work in your groups and write your own **linked class Node** to do the following.

1. The constructor takes a string and sets it's value member of the class, sets the next member which is of type Node to null
2. Have functions so that you can get and set the next  member of the class called getNext and setNext


Create a linked list class called **MyLinkedList** and do the following.

1. Have a function called "add" which adds a Node object to the very end of the list.
2. Have a function called "remove" which removes the Node object from the very end of the list.
3. Have a function called "add" which takes an index argument (optional) that can add a value at the index in the list.
4. Have a function called "remove" which takes an index argument (optional) that can remove a value at the index from the list.
5. Next, which returns the next node object

In your **program** do the following:

1. Create the linked list object.
2. Call the linked list object function "add" to add your Node objects with the values "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"
3. Loop through the linked list and print each node's values
4. Delete from the linked list the node with value "C"
5. Add to the linked list at index 2 a new node with a value "Z"
